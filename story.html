    <h1>Monkey & Crocodile</h1>
    <a href="index.html">About projects </a>
<p>The crocodile told the monkey that he had a wife and that they lived on the other side of the river. So the generous monkey plucked many rose-apples and gave them to the crocodile for his wife. ... She pretended as if she did not believe that her husband, a crocodile, could be friends with a monkey.
